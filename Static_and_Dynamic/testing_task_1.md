### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
```ruby

class CardGame

# need to set getter for class and then initialize

  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  # could update the name of the method, so it matches the snake case convention used for the other method names
  # should use double equals to compare card value to 1
  # could use .each, instead of an if statement if wanted to do so

  dif highest_card(card1 card2)   
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end

# should be 'def' not 'dif'
# should be returning 'card1' rather than 'card'
# includes an extra 'end'



def self.cards_total(cards)
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  end
end

# don't have to use 'self.'
# total should equal zero
# would need to ensure total is converted to a string, if want to test the returned statement, "You have a total of x"

```
